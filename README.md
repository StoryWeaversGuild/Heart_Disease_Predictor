❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning. I used Random Forest with Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning, achieving 89% accuracy.

📌 Features

1.Preprocessed dataset for training and testing

2.Random Forest Classifier with optimized parameters

3.Bayesian Optimization (bayes-opt) for tuning

4.Jupyter Notebook with clean, step-by-step workflow

5.Ready-to-use template for experimenting with different models

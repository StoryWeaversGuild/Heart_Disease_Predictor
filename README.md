❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning. I used Random Forest with Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning, achieving 89% accuracy.

📌 Features

1.Preprocessed dataset for training and testing

2.Random Forest Classifier with optimized parameters

3.Bayesian Optimization (bayes-opt) for tuning

4.Jupyter Notebook with clean, step-by-step workflow

5.Ready-to-use template for experimenting with different models

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3.x

scikit-learn

bayes-opt

pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn

📊 Results

Model: Random Forest with Bayesian Optimization

Accuracy: ~89%

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

📌 Future Improvements

Try XGBoost/LightGBM for higher performance

Add a Streamlit/Flask web app for user-friendly predictions

Deploy the model with Docker/Cloud

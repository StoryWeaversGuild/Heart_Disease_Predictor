### **1\. Data Collection 💾**

The dataset for this project was sourced from **Kaggle**. Kaggle provides a vast repository of real-world data, which is ideal for building and testing machine learning models.

* **Source:** Kaggle Datasets  
* **Method:** The data was downloaded as a .csv file and loaded into our project environment for analysis.

### **2\. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊**

A thorough EDA was performed to understand the patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data.

* Tool: We primarily used the Pandas library for data manipulation, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.  
  \<br\>  
* **Visualizations:** A correlation heatmap was generated to understand the relationships between different features.

### **3\. Data Preprocessing & Feature Scaling ⚙️**

To prepare the data for our models, we performed several preprocessing steps, including one-hot encoding for categorical variables and feature scaling.

* Feature Scaling: We used StandardScaler from Scikit-learn to standardize the features, ensuring they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1\.

### **4\. Baseline Model: Logistic Regression 🎯**

A simple baseline model was established using Logistic Regression to set a performance benchmark.

* **Result:** The baseline model achieved an accuracy of **84%** on the test set.

### **5\. Evaluating Multiple ML Algorithms 📈**

We trained and evaluated several ML algorithms to find the best-performing model for our dataset.

* **Algorithms Tested:** Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost.  
* **Performance Comparison:**  
  *Fig 2: Bar chart comparing the accuracy of different models.*

### **6\. Hyperparameter Tuning with K-Fold Cross-Validation 🎛️**

The best model, Random Forest, was fine-tuned using K-Fold Cross-Validation to maximize its performance.

* **Final Result:** After tuning, the **Random Forest Classifier** achieved an improved accuracy of **89.1%**.  
* **Final Model Evaluation:** A confusion matrix was used to assess the final model's performance in detail.  
  *Fig 3: Confusion matrix for the final Random Forest model.*

### **7\. Deployment with Flask 🚀**

The final model was deployed as a web application using the Flask framework.

* Framework: Flask was used to build the backend API that serves the model's predictions.

### **8\. Frontend Interface 💻**

A simple user interface was created to interact with the deployed model.

* Technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
